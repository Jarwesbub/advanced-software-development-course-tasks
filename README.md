# advanced-software-development-course-tasks
There are 3 main coding tasks from the course: "Advanced Software Development Techniques" (Oulu University of Applied Sciences). These main tasks are heavily focused on multithreading inside Python. There are handlers, listeners and various classes doing all the heavy lifting while Python's "tkinter" module makes the raw visual presentation. 

This repository contains multiple projects packed in one body. Every folder has the info about the task and final code written in Python by me. Demonstration videos can be found inside the code tasks (in comment at the top).

Here is a little demonstration from the task 3:
