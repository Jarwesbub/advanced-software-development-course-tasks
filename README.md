# advanced-software-development-course-tasks
There are 3 main coding tasks from the course: "Advanced Software Development Techniques" (Oulu University of Applied Sciences).

This repository contains multiple projects packed in one body. Every folder has the info about the task and final code written in Python by me. Demonstration videos can be found inside the code tasks. (In comment at the top)
